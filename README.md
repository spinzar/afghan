```bash
To convert days, months, and years between the Afghan and Gregorian calendars for the purpose of finding people's age, you can follow these steps:

Create a function called convertDaysToYears. This function will convert a number of days to a number of years, taking into account the different lengths of the Afghan and Gregorian calendars.

Create a function called convertMonthsToYears. This function will convert a number of months to a number of years, taking into account the different lengths of the Afghan and Gregorian calendars.

Create a function called convertYearsToDays. This function will convert a number of years to a number of days, taking into account the different lengths of the Afghan and Gregorian calendars.

Create a function called convertYearsToMonths. This function will convert a number of years to a number of months, taking into account the different lengths of the Afghan and Gregorian calendars.

Create a function called calculateAgeInAfghanYears. This function will calculate a person's age in Afghan years, given their birth date and the current date.

Create a function called calculateAgeInGregorianYears. This function will calculate a person's age in Gregorian years, given their birth date and the current date.

Here is some sample code for these functions:

PHP
function convertDaysToYears($days, $calendar)
{
    $years = 0;
    if ($calendar === 'afghan') {
        $years = $days / 365.25;
    } elseif ($calendar === 'gregorian') {
        $years = $days / 365.2422;
    }

    return $years;
}

function convertMonthsToYears($months, $calendar)
{
    $years = 0;
    if ($calendar === 'afghan') {
        $years = $months / 12;
    } elseif ($calendar === 'gregorian') {
        $years = $months / 12;
    }

    return $years;
}

function convertYearsToDays($years, $calendar)
{
    $days = 0;
    if ($calendar === 'afghan') {
        $days = $years * 365.25;
    } elseif ($calendar === 'gregorian') {
        $days = $years * 365.2422;
    }

    return $days;
}

function convertYearsToMonths($years, $calendar)
{
    $months = 0;
    if ($calendar === 'afghan') {
        $months = $years * 12;
    } elseif ($calendar === 'gregorian') {
        $months = $years * 12;
    }

    return $months;
}

function calculateAgeInAfghanYears($birthDate, $currentDate)
{
    $ageInDays = convertDaysToYears(convertYearsToDays($currentDate) - convertYearsToDays($birthDate), 'afghan');
    $ageInYears = convertDaysToYears($ageInDays, 'afghan');

    return $ageInYears;
}

function calculateAgeInGregorianYears($birthDate, $currentDate)
{
    $ageInDays = convertDaysToYears(convertYearsToDays($currentDate) - convertYearsToDays($birthDate), 'gregorian');
    $ageInYears = convertDaysToYears($ageInDays, 'gregorian');

    return $ageInYears;
}

To use these functions, you can simply pass in the necessary parameters and the function will return the desired result. For example, to calculate a person's age in Afghan years, you would use the following code:

PHP
$birthDate = '1980-03-21';
$currentDate = '2023-09-25';

$ageInAfghanYears = calculateAgeInAfghanYears($birthDate, $currentDate);

echo $ageInAfghanYears; // 43

You can also use these functions to convert days, months, and years between the Afghan and Gregorian calendars for other purposes, such as calculating the date of a future event or the number of days between two dates.
